I need a Plotly chart configuration as a Python dictionary. 
The data has a single column with the header __header__. 
The values are categorical, like __ditinct_value__. 
Please create a bar chart that shows the count of each __header__. 
The x-axis should be favorite_fruit and the y-axis should be count. 
The chart's title should be "__header__ Count."
