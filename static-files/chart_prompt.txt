I need a Plotly chart configuration, specifically a Python dictionary, to visualize sales data. 
The dataset has the following headers: order_date, product_name, region, and revenue. . 
Please create a line chart that shows the trend of revenue over order_date. 
The chart should have the title "Revenue Trend by Date" and include a tooltip that shows both the date and the corresponding revenue. 
The x-axis label should be "Date" and the y-axis label should be "Revenue (USD)".
